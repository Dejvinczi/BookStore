# BookStore

BookStore is a comprehensive web application for an online bookstore, serving as both a consolidation of my current web development knowledge and a platform for exploring new technologies and practices. This project represents a culmination of my skills while also pushing the boundaries of my expertise into new areas.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- *in progres...*

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/dejvinczi/bookstore.git
   cd bookstore
   ```
2. Create .env file from .env.template and edit it. (**ðŸš¨IMPORTANT** - There is no proxy server in the development environment - it exists only in the test and production environment. If you want to make queries to the API in the development environment, you need to set **NEXT_PUBLIC_API_PORT=8000** pointing directly to the Django server.
   ```
   cp .env.template .env
   ```

3. Build the Docker containers (choose one of the following as appropriate):

   3.1. Development composition:
   ```
   docker-compose -f development.yaml build
   ```
   3.2. Testing composition:
   ```
   docker-compose -f testing.yaml build
   ```
   3.3. Production composition:
   ```
   docker-compose -f production.yaml build
   ```
## Usage

1. Navigate to the root directory of the repository:
   ```
   cd bookstore
   ```

2. Run the Docker containers (choose one of the following as appropriate):

   2.1. Development composition:
   ```
   docker-compose -f development.yaml up
   ```
   2.2. Testing composition:
   ```
   docker-compose -f testing.yaml up
   ```
   2.3. Production composition:
   ```
   docker-compose -f production.yaml up
   ```

3. Navigate your browser to url:

   3.1. Development composition:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend: http://localhost:8000

   3.2. Production composition:
   - http://localhost:1337

## Testing

You can run tests with coverage using `pytest` on the testing server:


1. Navigate to the root directory of the repository:
   ```
   cd bookstore
   ```

2. Run docker testing composition:
   ```
   docker-compose -f testing.yaml up
   ```

3. In another terminal run the following command:
   ```
   docker-compose -f testing.yaml exec api pytest
   ```
